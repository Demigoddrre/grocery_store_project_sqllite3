## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- **Python 3.x** and **pip**
- **SQLite 3** (default with Python installation)
- Internet connection (for SendGrid API)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd grocery_store_project
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Set Up the Database
Create the necessary tables:
```bash
python3 database/create_tables.py
```
This script will initialize the database in `database/grocery_store.db`.

#### 4. Populate Test Data (Optional)
Add sample data to the database for testing:
```bash
python3 database/populate_test_data.py
```

#### 5. Configure Email Sending

## Usage

### Run the Application
Start the console-based management system:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Available Menu Options
1. **Generate Reports**: Create CSV files for earnings or product performance.

3. **Send Reports via Email**: Email reports using the SendGrid integration.
4. **Execute Operations**: Manage inventory, loyalty points, and other operations.
5. **Exit**: Close the application.

### Example Workflow
1. Run the application: `python3 main.py`.
2. Select **1. Generate Report** and specify the type and time period.
3. Select **2. View Graphs** to generate a visualization.
4. Select **3. Send Reports via Email** to email reports.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
- Ensure `create_tables.py` has been run to create necessary tables.
- Check the database path in `database/config.py`:
  ```python
  def connect_to_db():
      return sqlite3.connect("database/grocery_store.db")
  ```

### Email Sending Errors
- Confirm `.env` contains a valid `SENDGRID_API_KEY` and `SENDER_EMAIL`.
- Ensure the SendGrid API key is active.

### Graph or Report Errors
- Confirm data exists in the database tables using SQLite CLI:
  ```bash
  sqlite3 database/grocery_store.db
  sqlite> SELECT * FROM Orders;
  ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add a web interface for improved usability.
- Expand reporting options with detailed filtering.
- Integrate with cloud services for report storage.
